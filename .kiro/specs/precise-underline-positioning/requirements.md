# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Drools VSCode extension must provide precise error underlines that highlight only the problematic text without including leading or trailing whitespace. This ensures a clean, professional user experience and helps developers quickly identify the exact location of issues in their Drools rule files.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Drools developer, I want error underlines to highlight only the problematic text, so that I can quickly identify what exactly needs to be fixed without visual clutter.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a variable is missing the $ prefix THEN the system SHALL underline only the variable name without any surrounding whitespace
2. WHEN an undefined variable is used THEN the system SHALL underline only the variable name including the $ prefix without any surrounding whitespace
3. WHEN a Java capitalization error occurs THEN the system SHALL underline only the incorrectly capitalized word without any surrounding whitespace
4. WHEN a Java typo is detected THEN the system SHALL underline only the misspelled word without any surrounding whitespace

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a Drools developer working with indented code, I want error underlines to work accurately across different indentation levels, so that I can maintain consistent code formatting while still getting precise error feedback.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an error occurs in deeply indented code THEN the system SHALL position the underline accurately regardless of indentation level
2. WHEN an error spans multiple lines THEN the system SHALL find the correct position within the multi-line construct
3. WHEN code uses mixed indentation (spaces and tabs) THEN the system SHALL calculate positions correctly
4. WHEN variables appear at different indentation levels THEN the system SHALL underline each occurrence precisely

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a Drools developer, I want consistent underline behavior across all error types, so that I have a predictable and professional editing experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any type of validation error occurs THEN the system SHALL use word boundary matching to ensure precise positioning
2. WHEN multiple instances of the same error exist THEN the system SHALL position each underline accurately
3. WHEN special characters are present in variable names THEN the system SHALL handle regex escaping correctly
4. WHEN errors occur in complex expressions THEN the system SHALL identify the exact problematic token

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a Drools developer, I want the extension to handle edge cases in underline positioning, so that I get accurate feedback even in complex or unusual code structures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a variable name contains special regex characters THEN the system SHALL escape them properly for accurate matching
2. WHEN the same word appears multiple times on a line THEN the system SHALL underline the correct occurrence
3. WHEN code contains comments or strings with similar text THEN the system SHALL distinguish between actual code and text content
4. WHEN rules have complex nested structures THEN the system SHALL maintain accurate positioning throughout the rule hierarchy

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a Drools developer, I want visual confirmation that underlines are positioned correctly, so that I can trust the extension's error reporting.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing an error underline THEN the system SHALL ensure no leading whitespace is included in the underline range
2. WHEN viewing an error underline THEN the system SHALL ensure no trailing whitespace is included in the underline range
3. WHEN multiple errors exist on the same line THEN the system SHALL position each underline independently and accurately
4. WHEN errors occur at the beginning or end of lines THEN the system SHALL handle boundary conditions correctly
