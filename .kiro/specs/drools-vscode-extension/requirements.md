# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a Visual Studio Code extension that provides comprehensive syntax highlighting and editing support for Drools Rule Language (.drl) files. The extension will enhance the developer experience when working with Drools business rules by providing proper syntax coloring, code completion, error detection, and other IDE features commonly expected for programming languages.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Drools developer, I want proper syntax highlighting for .drl files, so that I can easily distinguish between different language constructs and improve code readability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a .drl file is opened THEN the extension SHALL apply syntax highlighting to keywords, strings, comments, and operators
2. WHEN viewing rule declarations THEN the extension SHALL highlight rule names, when conditions, and then actions with distinct colors
3. WHEN viewing package declarations and imports THEN the extension SHALL highlight these with appropriate syntax coloring
4. WHEN viewing function definitions THEN the extension SHALL highlight function keywords, parameters, and return types

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a Drools developer, I want code completion and IntelliSense support, so that I can write rules more efficiently with fewer syntax errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN typing Drools keywords THEN the extension SHALL provide auto-completion suggestions
2. WHEN typing within rule conditions THEN the extension SHALL suggest available fact types and properties
3. WHEN typing function calls THEN the extension SHALL provide parameter hints and documentation
4. WHEN typing import statements THEN the extension SHALL suggest available Java classes

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a Drools developer, I want basic error detection and validation, so that I can identify syntax issues before running my rules.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN there are syntax errors in the .drl file THEN the extension SHALL underline problematic code with red squiggles
2. WHEN there are missing semicolons or brackets THEN the extension SHALL highlight these as errors
3. WHEN there are undefined variables or facts THEN the extension SHALL show warning indicators
4. WHEN hovering over errors THEN the extension SHALL display helpful error messages

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a Drools developer, I want code formatting and indentation support, so that my rule files maintain consistent styling.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using format document command THEN the extension SHALL properly indent rule blocks and conditions
2. WHEN pressing enter after rule declarations THEN the extension SHALL auto-indent the next line appropriately
3. WHEN typing closing brackets THEN the extension SHALL automatically align them with their opening counterparts
4. WHEN formatting is applied THEN the extension SHALL maintain consistent spacing around operators and keywords

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a Drools developer, I want bracket matching and code folding, so that I can navigate complex rule files more easily.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN clicking on opening brackets THEN the extension SHALL highlight the corresponding closing bracket
2. WHEN the cursor is near brackets THEN the extension SHALL show matching bracket pairs
3. WHEN viewing large rule blocks THEN the extension SHALL provide code folding capabilities for rules and functions
4. WHEN folding code THEN the extension SHALL show summary information about the folded content

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a Drools developer, I want automatic formatting when I save .drl files, so that my code maintains consistent style without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN saving a .drl file THEN the extension SHALL automatically format the entire document
2. WHEN format-on-save is enabled THEN the extension SHALL apply proper indentation to all rule blocks
3. WHEN saving occurs THEN the extension SHALL normalize spacing around operators and keywords
4. WHEN auto-formatting is applied THEN the extension SHALL preserve the logical structure and functionality of the rules

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a Drools developer, I want to save and use code snippets for common Drools rule patterns, so that I can quickly insert frequently used rule structures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN typing snippet triggers THEN the extension SHALL provide pre-defined Drools rule templates
2. WHEN using snippets THEN the extension SHALL include common patterns like basic rules, conditional rules, and function definitions
3. WHEN inserting snippets THEN the extension SHALL provide tab stops for easy customization of rule names, conditions, and actions
4. WHEN snippets are inserted THEN the extension SHALL allow users to save custom snippets for reuse

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a Drools developer, I want the extension to recognize .drl file associations, so that the features activate automatically when I open Drools files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN opening files with .drl extension THEN the extension SHALL automatically activate
2. WHEN the language mode is set to "drools" THEN the extension SHALL apply all syntax features
3. WHEN creating new .drl files THEN the extension SHALL provide appropriate file templates
4. WHEN the extension is installed THEN it SHALL register itself as the default handler for .drl files
