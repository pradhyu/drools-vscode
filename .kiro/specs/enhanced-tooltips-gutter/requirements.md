# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Drools VSCode extension must provide enhanced tooltips with rich syntax highlighting and visual gutter indicators for errors and suggestions. This will improve the developer experience by making error messages more readable and providing clear visual cues in the editor gutter for quick identification of issues.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Drools developer, I want rich syntax-highlighted tooltips for error messages, so that I can quickly understand the problem and see the code context with proper formatting.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN hovering over an error underline THEN the system SHALL display a tooltip with Markdown-formatted syntax highlighting
2. WHEN the tooltip contains Java code THEN the system SHALL highlight Java keywords, types, methods, and literals with appropriate formatting
3. WHEN the tooltip contains Drools code THEN the system SHALL highlight Drools keywords, variables, operators, and fact types with appropriate formatting
4. WHEN the tooltip contains error tokens THEN the system SHALL use strikethrough formatting to clearly indicate the problematic text
5. WHEN the tooltip includes position information THEN the system SHALL format it with bold text for easy identification

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a Drools developer, I want tooltips to show code context around errors, so that I can understand the error in the broader context of my code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an error occurs THEN the tooltip SHALL include 1-2 lines of code context around the error location
2. WHEN displaying code context THEN the system SHALL include line numbers for easy reference
3. WHEN the error token appears in the context THEN the system SHALL highlight it with strikethrough formatting
4. WHEN the context includes multiple lines THEN the system SHALL maintain proper indentation and formatting

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a Drools developer, I want tooltips to provide helpful suggestions and corrections, so that I can quickly fix errors without having to research the solution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a capitalization error occurs THEN the tooltip SHALL show a "Replace X with Y" suggestion with syntax highlighting
2. WHEN a typo is detected THEN the tooltip SHALL show a before/after comparison with proper highlighting
3. WHEN an undefined variable is used THEN the tooltip SHALL provide a tip on how to declare the variable correctly
4. WHEN suggestions are provided THEN the system SHALL format them with clear headings and code blocks

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a Drools developer, I want visual gutter indicators for errors and warnings, so that I can quickly scan my file and identify all issues at a glance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a syntax error occurs on a line THEN the system SHALL display a red error icon in the editor gutter
2. WHEN a semantic warning occurs on a line THEN the system SHALL display a yellow warning icon in the editor gutter
3. WHEN a best practice suggestion exists on a line THEN the system SHALL display a blue info icon in the editor gutter
4. WHEN multiple issues exist on the same line THEN the system SHALL display the highest severity icon (error > warning > info)

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a Drools developer, I want gutter indicators to be clickable and provide quick access to error information, so that I can efficiently navigate and fix issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN clicking on a gutter error icon THEN the system SHALL show the error tooltip immediately
2. WHEN clicking on a gutter warning icon THEN the system SHALL show the warning tooltip immediately
3. WHEN clicking on a gutter info icon THEN the system SHALL show the suggestion tooltip immediately
4. WHEN hovering over gutter icons THEN the system SHALL show a preview of the issue type

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a Drools developer, I want consistent tooltip styling that matches VSCode's theme, so that the enhanced tooltips feel native to the editor environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying tooltips THEN the system SHALL use VSCode's native tooltip styling and colors
2. WHEN the editor theme changes THEN the tooltip highlighting SHALL adapt to the new theme colors
3. WHEN using dark themes THEN the syntax highlighting SHALL use appropriate contrast colors
4. WHEN using light themes THEN the syntax highlighting SHALL use appropriate contrast colors

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a Drools developer, I want tooltips to be performant and responsive, so that they don't slow down my editing experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN hovering over errors THEN tooltips SHALL appear within 200ms
2. WHEN moving between errors quickly THEN the system SHALL handle tooltip transitions smoothly
3. WHEN working with large files THEN tooltip generation SHALL not cause noticeable delays
4. WHEN multiple tooltips are requested rapidly THEN the system SHALL handle them efficiently without memory leaks
