# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves improving the Drools parser in the VSCode extension to properly handle multi-line condition patterns where parentheses can span multiple lines. Currently, the parser may not correctly recognize valid Drools syntax when condition patterns are split across multiple lines, leading to incorrect syntax highlighting, formatting, and error detection.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Drools developer, I want the parser to correctly handle multi-line condition patterns, so that valid Drools syntax is properly recognized regardless of line breaks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a condition pattern has opening parenthesis on one line and closing parenthesis on another line THEN the parser SHALL recognize it as valid syntax
2. WHEN formatting multi-line condition patterns THEN the extension SHALL maintain proper indentation and structure
3. WHEN syntax highlighting multi-line patterns THEN the extension SHALL apply consistent coloring across line breaks
4. WHEN validating multi-line patterns THEN the extension SHALL not report false syntax errors

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a Drools developer, I want proper syntax highlighting for complex multi-line patterns, so that I can easily read and understand nested conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing multi-line exists() patterns THEN the extension SHALL highlight the entire pattern correctly
2. WHEN viewing multi-line not() patterns THEN the extension SHALL highlight the entire pattern correctly
3. WHEN viewing multi-line eval() patterns THEN the extension SHALL highlight the entire pattern correctly
4. WHEN viewing nested parentheses across lines THEN the extension SHALL match brackets correctly

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a Drools developer, I want accurate error detection for multi-line patterns, so that I can identify real syntax issues without false positives.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN there are unmatched parentheses in multi-line patterns THEN the extension SHALL report the error accurately
2. WHEN there are valid multi-line patterns THEN the extension SHALL not report false syntax errors
3. WHEN there are syntax errors within multi-line patterns THEN the extension SHALL pinpoint the exact location
4. WHEN hovering over multi-line pattern errors THEN the extension SHALL provide helpful error messages

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a Drools developer, I want proper code completion within multi-line patterns, so that I can efficiently write complex conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN typing within multi-line condition patterns THEN the extension SHALL provide appropriate keyword completions
2. WHEN typing fact types in multi-line patterns THEN the extension SHALL suggest available types
3. WHEN typing operators in multi-line patterns THEN the extension SHALL provide operator completions
4. WHEN typing within nested patterns THEN the extension SHALL understand the context correctly

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a Drools developer, I want consistent formatting for multi-line patterns, so that my code maintains readable structure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN formatting multi-line condition patterns THEN the extension SHALL apply proper indentation to nested levels
2. WHEN formatting multi-line patterns THEN the extension SHALL align closing parentheses appropriately
3. WHEN auto-formatting on save THEN the extension SHALL preserve the logical structure of multi-line patterns
4. WHEN formatting ranges containing multi-line patterns THEN the extension SHALL handle partial formatting correctly

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a Drools developer, I want the parser to follow the official Drools ANTLR grammar, so that the extension supports all valid Drools syntax constructs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN parsing condition patterns THEN the extension SHALL follow the DRL6Expressions.g grammar rules
2. WHEN parsing complex expressions THEN the extension SHALL support all ANTLR-defined constructs
3. WHEN encountering edge cases THEN the extension SHALL handle them according to the official grammar
4. WHEN new Drools syntax is added to the grammar THEN the extension SHALL be easily extensible to support it
