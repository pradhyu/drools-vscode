  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3_

- [x] 3. Implement enhanced rule name validator
  - Create EnhancedRuleNameValidator class with proper quoted name handling
  - Implement isQuotedRuleName method to correctly detect quoted rule names
  - Add extractUnquotedRuleName method to safely extract content from quoted names
  - Create validateQuotedRuleName method for quoted rule name validation
  - Implement validateUnquotedRuleName method for unquoted rule name validation
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4_

- [x] 4. Fix rule name validation logic for quoted names

  - Update validation logic to properly handle quoted rule names with spaces
  - Add support for escape sequences within quoted rule names
  - Implement proper error messages for different rule name validation scenarios
  - Test that quoted rule names with spaces are correctly accepted as valid
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.4_

- [x] 5. Add comprehensive rule name validation test cases
  - Write tests for quoted rule names with spaces (should be valid)
  - Add tests for unquoted rule names with spaces (should warn to add quotes)
  - Create tests for edge cases: empty names, special characters, Unicode
  - Test escape sequences in quoted rule names
  - Add tests for very long rule names and appropriate warnings
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4_

- [x] 6. Integrate validation coordination into diagnostic provider
  - Refactor provideDiagnostics method to use coordinateValidation approach
  - Add validation state reset at the beginning of each validation cycle
  - Implement proper validation type checking before running each validation phase
  - Update all validation method calls to use the coordination system
  - Ensure backward compatibility with existing diagnostic provider interface
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.3, 1.5, 3.1, 3.3_

- [x] 7. Add validation error handling and recovery
  - Implement ValidationErrorHandler class for graceful error handling
  - Add try-catch blocks around individual validation phases
  - Create error isolation to prevent one validation failure from breaking others
  - Implement fallback logic for when enhanced validation fails
  - Add logging for validation errors without exposing them to users
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3_

- [x] 8. Create performance monitoring for validation
  - Add timing measurements for validation phases
  - Implement metrics collection for duplicate prevention
  - Create performance benchmarks for validation speed
  - Add memory usage monitoring for validation state
  - Implement caching strategies for repeated validation operations
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5_

- [x] 9. Write comprehensive integration tests
  - Create end-to-end tests that validate complete rule files without duplication
  - Test validation coordination across multiple validation types
  - Add performance tests for large files with many rules
  - Create regression tests to ensure existing functionality still works
  - Test validation behavior with different settings combinations
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 3.1, 3.2_

- [ ] 10. Update validation settings and configuration
  - Ensure validation settings properly control each validation type
  - Add configuration options for enhanced rule name validation
  - Implement feature flags for new validation logic if needed
  - Update validation settings documentation and examples
  - Test that validation settings changes are immediately reflected
  - _Requirements: 3.4, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3_

- [ ] 11. Add validation result deduplication
  - Implement diagnostic deduplication logic to remove identical error messages
  - Create efficient comparison methods for diagnostic objects
  - Add deduplication at the diagnostic provider level
  - Ensure deduplication doesn't remove legitimate duplicate errors from different sources
  - Test that deduplication works correctly with various error scenarios
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 1.3, 3.3_

- [ ] 12. Create validation debugging and troubleshooting tools
  - Add debug logging for validation coordination flow
  - Implement validation metrics reporting for development
  - Create diagnostic tools to identify validation performance issues
  - Add validation state inspection methods for debugging
  - Ensure debug information doesn't impact production performance
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 5.1, 5.2_
