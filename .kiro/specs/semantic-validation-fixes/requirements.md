# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical bugs in the Drools VSCode extension's semantic validation system. Currently, there are two main issues: (1) semantic validation logic is running twice, causing duplicate error messages, and (2) the rule name validator incorrectly flags quoted rule names with spaces as invalid, even though they are syntactically correct in Drools.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Drools developer, I want semantic validation to run only once per document, so that I don't see duplicate error messages cluttering my Problems panel.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN semantic validation is enabled THEN the system SHALL execute semantic validation logic exactly once per validation cycle
2. WHEN a semantic error exists THEN the system SHALL report it only once in the diagnostics
3. WHEN multiple validation passes occur THEN the system SHALL not accumulate duplicate semantic errors
4. WHEN semantic validation is disabled THEN the system SHALL not run any semantic validation logic
5. WHEN the document is parsed THEN the system SHALL coordinate validation phases to prevent duplication

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a Drools developer, I want rule names with spaces to be correctly validated when properly quoted, so that I can use descriptive rule names without false error messages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a rule name contains spaces and is enclosed in double quotes THEN the system SHALL accept it as valid
2. WHEN a rule name contains spaces without quotes THEN the system SHALL flag it as an error
3. WHEN a rule name is quoted but contains invalid characters THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate error messages
4. WHEN a rule name follows Drools naming conventions THEN the system SHALL not generate false positive errors
5. WHEN validating rule names THEN the system SHALL distinguish between quoted and unquoted rule names

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a Drools developer, I want consistent and accurate semantic validation behavior, so that I can trust the extension's error reporting and focus on actual code issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN semantic validation runs THEN the system SHALL provide consistent results across multiple validation cycles
2. WHEN validation logic is updated THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing rule syntax
3. WHEN errors are reported THEN the system SHALL provide clear, non-duplicate messages with accurate positioning
4. WHEN validation settings change THEN the system SHALL immediately reflect the changes without requiring restart
5. WHEN multiple validation types are enabled THEN the system SHALL coordinate them to prevent conflicts

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a Drools developer, I want the extension to properly handle edge cases in rule name validation, so that complex but valid rule names are accepted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN rule names contain special characters within quotes THEN the system SHALL validate them correctly
2. WHEN rule names use escape sequences within quotes THEN the system SHALL handle them appropriately
3. WHEN rule names are empty or contain only whitespace THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate error messages
4. WHEN rule names exceed reasonable length limits THEN the system SHALL provide warnings but not errors
5. WHEN rule names contain Unicode characters THEN the system SHALL handle them correctly within quoted names

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a Drools developer, I want the semantic validation system to be performant and not impact my development workflow, so that I can work efficiently without delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN semantic validation runs THEN the system SHALL complete validation within reasonable time limits
2. WHEN large files are validated THEN the system SHALL not cause noticeable performance degradation
3. WHEN validation is triggered frequently THEN the system SHALL use caching to avoid redundant work
4. WHEN validation errors are fixed THEN the system SHALL quickly update the diagnostics without full re-validation
5. WHEN multiple files are open THEN the system SHALL manage validation resources efficiently
