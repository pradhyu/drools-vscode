# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will provide comprehensive auto-completion support for both LHS (Drools) and RHS (Java) contexts in Drools rules. The system will offer intelligent suggestions for Java built-in classes, methods, collections, streams, lambdas, date/time APIs, and utility functions, along with enhanced syntax highlighting for modern Java features. This goes beyond simple snippets to provide full IntelliSense-style completion with method signatures, parameter hints, and contextual suggestions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Drools developer, I want comprehensive Java auto-completion in the RHS (then clause), so that I can efficiently write Java code with full API support and method suggestions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I type in the then clause THEN the system SHALL provide auto-completion for Java built-in classes (String, List, Map, LocalDate, etc.)
2. WHEN I type a dot after an object THEN the system SHALL show available methods with signatures and documentation
3. WHEN I use collections THEN the system SHALL provide completion for ArrayList, HashMap, Set operations with proper generic type support
4. WHEN I work with streams THEN the system SHALL provide completion for filter, map, collect, forEach and other stream operations
5. WHEN I use modern Java features THEN the system SHALL support Optional, LocalDate, Duration, and other Java 8+ APIs

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a Drools developer, I want lambda expression and functional programming auto-completion, so that I can efficiently write modern Java code with streams and functional interfaces.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I use stream operations THEN the system SHALL provide lambda expression templates (e.g., `element -> condition`)
2. WHEN I type lambda syntax THEN the system SHALL provide completion for common functional interfaces (Predicate, Function, Consumer)
3. WHEN I use method references THEN the system SHALL suggest `::` syntax and available method references
4. WHEN I work with Optional THEN the system SHALL provide completion for map, filter, orElse, ifPresent methods

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a Drools developer, I want comprehensive java.util.* package auto-completion, so that I can access all utility classes and their methods without memorizing APIs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I type Collections THEN the system SHALL provide completion for sort, reverse, shuffle, min, max methods
2. WHEN I type Arrays THEN the system SHALL provide completion for asList, sort, binarySearch, copyOf methods
3. WHEN I use date/time APIs THEN the system SHALL provide completion for LocalDate, LocalDateTime, DateTimeFormatter methods
4. WHEN I work with concurrent utilities THEN the system SHALL provide completion for concurrent collections and executors

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a Drools developer, I want enhanced syntax highlighting for Java code in RHS, so that I can easily distinguish between different code elements and identify syntax errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I write Java code in then clause THEN the system SHALL highlight keywords, classes, methods, and literals with distinct colors
2. WHEN I use modern Java features THEN the system SHALL highlight var, record, sealed, and other modern keywords
3. WHEN I write lambda expressions THEN the system SHALL highlight arrow operators and functional syntax
4. WHEN I use string literals THEN the system SHALL highlight text blocks, escape sequences, and string interpolation

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a Drools developer, I want context-aware auto-completion that understands Drools vs Java contexts, so that I get relevant suggestions based on where I am in the rule.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I am in the when clause THEN the system SHALL prioritize Drools pattern matching and constraint syntax
2. WHEN I am in the then clause THEN the system SHALL prioritize Java auto-completion over Drools syntax
3. WHEN I type after a fact variable THEN the system SHALL provide completion for fact properties and methods
4. WHEN I use Drools built-ins THEN the system SHALL provide completion for modify, update, insert, retract operations

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a Drools developer, I want auto-completion for mathematical and utility operations, so that I can efficiently perform calculations and data transformations in rules.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I type Math THEN the system SHALL provide completion for abs, max, min, pow, sqrt, random methods
2. WHEN I work with BigDecimal THEN the system SHALL provide completion for add, subtract, multiply, divide, compareTo methods
3. WHEN I use String operations THEN the system SHALL provide completion for length, substring, indexOf, replace, split methods
4. WHEN I work with numbers THEN the system SHALL provide completion for Integer, Long, Double wrapper methods

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a Drools developer, I want auto-completion with parameter hints and documentation, so that I understand method signatures and can write correct code without external references.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I select a method from completion THEN the system SHALL show parameter names and types
2. WHEN I hover over completed methods THEN the system SHALL show detailed documentation and examples
3. WHEN I type method parameters THEN the system SHALL provide hints for expected parameter types
4. WHEN methods are overloaded THEN the system SHALL show all available signatures

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a Drools developer, I want auto-completion for exception handling and control flow, so that I can write robust Java code with proper error handling.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I type try THEN the system SHALL provide completion for try-catch-finally blocks
2. WHEN I work with exceptions THEN the system SHALL provide completion for common exception types
3. WHEN I use control flow THEN the system SHALL provide completion for if, switch, for, while statements
4. WHEN I handle resources THEN the system SHALL provide completion for try-with-resources syntax

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a Drools developer, I want performance-optimized auto-completion, so that suggestions appear quickly even in large files without impacting editor responsiveness.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I trigger auto-completion THEN the system SHALL respond within 100ms for typical completion requests
2. WHEN working with large files THEN the system SHALL maintain responsive completion performance
3. WHEN multiple completion sources are available THEN the system SHALL prioritize and merge results efficiently
4. WHEN completion is not needed THEN the system SHALL not consume excessive CPU or memory resources

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a Drools developer, I want configurable auto-completion behavior, so that I can customize the completion experience to match my coding preferences and project needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I configure settings THEN the system SHALL allow enabling/disabling different completion categories
2. WHEN I set preferences THEN the system SHALL allow customizing completion priority and sorting
3. WHEN I work on different projects THEN the system SHALL support project-specific completion settings
4. WHEN I need minimal completions THEN the system SHALL allow disabling advanced features for performance
