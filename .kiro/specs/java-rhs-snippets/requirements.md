# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will provide comprehensive Java and Drools-specific code snippets for the RHS (then clause) portion of Drools rules. The snippets will help developers quickly insert common Java programming patterns and Drools-specific operations, significantly speeding up rule development and reducing syntax errors.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Drools developer, I want Java code snippets available in the then clause, so that I can quickly insert common Java programming patterns without typing them manually.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I am in the then clause of a Drools rule THEN the system SHALL provide Java code snippets for common programming patterns
2. WHEN I type a Java snippet trigger THEN the system SHALL expand it with proper placeholder navigation
3. WHEN I use Tab navigation THEN the system SHALL move between snippet placeholders correctly
4. WHEN snippets are expanded THEN the system SHALL maintain proper indentation within the rule context

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a Drools developer, I want Drools-specific snippets for fact manipulation, so that I can quickly perform common rule engine operations like update, insert, retract, and modify.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I am in the then clause THEN the system SHALL provide snippets for update, insert, retract, and modify operations
2. WHEN I use Drools snippets THEN the system SHALL generate syntactically correct Drools action code
3. WHEN I use modify blocks THEN the system SHALL provide proper syntax with multiple property setters
4. WHEN I access global variables THEN the system SHALL provide snippets for common global access patterns

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a Drools developer, I want snippets for Java control flow structures, so that I can quickly add conditional logic and loops to my rule actions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I need conditional logic THEN the system SHALL provide if, if-else, and switch statement snippets
2. WHEN I need iteration THEN the system SHALL provide for-loop, for-each, and while loop snippets
3. WHEN I need exception handling THEN the system SHALL provide try-catch block snippets
4. WHEN control flow snippets are used THEN the system SHALL provide proper placeholder navigation for conditions and bodies

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a Drools developer, I want snippets for Java collections and data structures, so that I can quickly work with lists, maps, and other common data types in rule actions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I need to work with collections THEN the system SHALL provide snippets for ArrayList, HashMap creation and manipulation
2. WHEN I use collection snippets THEN the system SHALL include proper generic type placeholders
3. WHEN I need collection operations THEN the system SHALL provide snippets for add, put, get, size, and isEmpty operations
4. WHEN working with streams THEN the system SHALL provide snippets for filter, map, and collect operations

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a Drools developer, I want snippets for common Java utility operations, so that I can quickly perform string manipulation, date operations, and mathematical calculations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I need string operations THEN the system SHALL provide snippets for String.format, StringBuilder, and string comparison
2. WHEN I need date operations THEN the system SHALL provide snippets for Date creation and SimpleDateFormat
3. WHEN I need mathematical operations THEN the system SHALL provide snippets for Math.random, Math.round, and other common math functions
4. WHEN I need logging THEN the system SHALL provide snippets for System.out.println and logger statements

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a Drools developer, I want context-aware snippet suggestions, so that Java and Drools snippets are prioritized when I'm in the then clause of a rule.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I am in the then clause THEN the system SHALL prioritize Java and Drools snippets over other snippet types
2. WHEN I am outside the then clause THEN the system SHALL show all snippets with normal priority
3. WHEN snippet completion is triggered THEN the system SHALL sort Java snippets higher in the then clause context
4. WHEN multiple snippets match THEN the system SHALL show the most relevant snippets first based on context

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a Drools developer, I want snippets for advanced Drools operations, so that I can access the knowledge context, working memory, and other rule engine features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I need rule engine access THEN the system SHALL provide snippets for kcontext operations
2. WHEN I need agenda control THEN the system SHALL provide snippets for agenda focus and halt operations
3. WHEN I need working memory access THEN the system SHALL provide snippets for direct working memory operations
4. WHEN I need query execution THEN the system SHALL provide snippets for query execution and result processing

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a Drools developer, I want comprehensive documentation for all snippets, so that I understand what each snippet does and how to use it effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I hover over a snippet THEN the system SHALL show detailed documentation about its purpose
2. WHEN snippets are listed THEN the system SHALL show brief descriptions for each snippet
3. WHEN I use a snippet THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful placeholder names that guide usage
4. WHEN documentation is provided THEN the system SHALL include usage examples and best practices
